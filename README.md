# General Conference Word Frequency

This is a very rough tool I quickly wrote to identify the frequency of words used in LDS General Conference talks.

The tool is written in Python and uses the BeautifulSoup library, so you'll need that installed.

The tool creates a file with the mostly decoded content of the talk, called words.txt, and then a CSV file of the words used (removing some commonly used words), the number of times the word is used, and the overall word count as a ratio of the total words in the talk.

Enjoy.
